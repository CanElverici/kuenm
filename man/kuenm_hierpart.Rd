\usage{
kuenm_hierpart(sp.name, fmod.dir, format = "ascii", replicated, project,
               current = NULL, time.periods = NULL, emi.scenarios = NULL,
               clim.models = NULL, ext.type, iterations = 100,
               sample.size = 1000, keep.tables = FALSE,
               factors.col, out.dir)
}
\arguments{
\item{sp.name}{(character) name of the species. This name must be the one
that appears as part of the raster file of each model replicate. If results
are from Maxent, this is the name that is in the first column of the csv
containing species occurrence data (species) but spaces replaced by "_".}

\item{fmod.dir}{(character) name of the folder where all models are (e.g.,
the output folder after using the \code{\link{kuenm_mod}}) function.}

\item{format}{(character) format of model raster files. Options are "ascii",
"GTiff", and "EHdr" = bil. Default = "ascii".}

\item{replicated}{(logical) whether or not models were created with
replicates.}

\item{project}{(logical) if TRUE, it is assumed that models were projected
to other scenarios. These scenarios can be current (projections in space),
and/or future or past (projections in time).}

\item{current}{(character) pattern to look for when defining which is the
raster file representing current projections. If NULL, results will be
produced for the area of calibration, and if any of \code{time.periods},
\code{clim.models}, or \code{emi.scenarios} is defined, results will be
be produced for these variance sources as well.}

\item{time.periods}{(character) pattern to be searched to identify model
projections to distinct time periods. If NULL, the default, it is assumed
that only one time period was considered.}

\item{emi.scenarios}{(character) pattern to be searched to identify
distinct emission scenarios (e.g., "recp45"). If NULL, the default, it is
assumed that only one emission scenario was used. Therefore, this source of
variation will not be considered.}

\item{clim.models}{(character) names that identify climatic models used for
project ENMs. If NULL, the default, it is assumed that only one climate model
was used. Therefore, this source of variation will not be considered.}

\item{ext.type}{(character) pattern(s) to be searched in the folders inside
\code{fmod.dir} that identify the extrapolation type(s) used in model
projections. This pattern(s) needs to be clearly distinguishable from the
other parts of the name of the folder name containing the model. For instance,
"EC" will be the patter that denotes extrapolation and clamping in the folder
named "M_0.1_F_l_set1_EC".}

\item{iterations}{(numeric) number of iterations to be performed in the
hierarchical partitioning analysis. Default = 100.}

\item{sample.size}{(numeric) number of pixels to be sampled per each model.
Default = 100. Increasing this number is recommended when the number of
models and the computer features allow it.}

\item{keep.tables}{(logical) if TRUE, tables that are written in
\code{out.dir} for each iteration of the hierarchical partitioning analyses
are kept. Default = FALSE.}

\item{factors.col}{a vector of colors for the bars to be plotted; if not
defined, a gray color palette is used.}

\item{out.dir}{(character) name of the output directory to be created
where results of the hierarchical partitioning analysis will be written.}

\item{verbose}{(logical) whether to print messages; default = TRUE.}
}
\value{
The function returns a data.frame containing the summary of total effects of
factors on variance contained in the models. A plot of these effects is also
returned.

Other results are written in \code{out.dir}. Folders named Variation or
HP_results_(EC, NE, and/or E, depending on \code{ext.type}) containing
csv files with the results of the hierarchical partitioning analyses an a
plot summarizing the total effects of the sources of variation on the
variance in the models.
}
\description{
kuenm_hierpart performs a hierarchical partitioning analysis of
the variance coming from distinct sources in ENMs. In this version potential
sources of variation are: replicates, parameterizations, general circulation
models (GCMs), and emission scenarios. The last two are considered only when
projections in time are performed. At least two of these sources of variation
must be present in results.
}
\details{
If the length of any of the potential sources of variation is equal to one
(e.g., only one parameter, or only one climate model), this source of
variation will not be considered.

Users must be specific when defining the patterns that the function will
search for. These patterns must be part of the raster file names of the
models so the function can locate each file without problems.

Error whiskers in resulting plots represent the 95\% Confidence Interval of
the mean. This interval is calculated using a bootstrap approach.
